For keep tracking of particular files in current working directory through git,
we have to move those files into stagin area 

to chekc whether our files are in staging area or not is git status command

to add our file into staging area we need git add command

to commit the changes we did in our file, we can use git commit command

to add message with commit we can write git commit -m "your_message"

Good practice to write commit messages in present tense

we can view the track of commits by using git log command
